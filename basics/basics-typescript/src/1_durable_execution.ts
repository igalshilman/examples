// Durable execution ensures code runs to the end, even in the presence of
// failures. Use this for code that updates different systems and needs to
// make sure all updates are applied.
//
//  - Failures are automatically retried, unless they are explicitly labeled
//    as terminal errors
//  - Restate journals execution progress. Re-tries use that journal to replay
//    previous already completed results, avoiding a repetition of that work and
//    ensuring stable deterministic values are used during execution.
//  - Durable executed functions use the regular code and control flow,
//    no custom DSLs
//

  // parameters are durable across retries
  const { userId, role, permissions } = update;

  // apply a change to one system (e.g., DB upsert, API call, ...)
  // the side effect persists the result with a consensus method so any
  // any later code relies on a deterministic result
  const success = await ctx.run(() => applyUserRole(userId, role));
  if (!success) {
    return;
  }

  // simply loop over the array or permission settings.
  // each operation through the Restate context is journaled and recovery restores
  // results of previous operations from the journal without re-executing them

// When invoking this function (see below for sample request), it will apply all

// You will see all lines of the type "Applied permission remove:allow for user Sam Beckett"
// in the log, across all retries. You will also see that re-tries will not re-execute
// previously completed actions again, so each line occurs only once.
